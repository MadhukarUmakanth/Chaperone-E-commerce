# Chaperone E-commerce Application

## Overview

Chaperone is an e-commerce application that allows users to browse and purchase various plants and gardening tools. The project is built using React for the frontend and integrates various features to enhance the user experience.

## Approach

In this project, I followed an agile development process, focusing on implementing user-centric features. The main components of the application include:

- **Header**: Navigation bar with links to different sections and a cart icon.
- **Product List**: Displays a list of products with options to view details and add to cart.
- **Thank You Page**: A custom page displayed after viewing a product, with a message thanking the user for their choice.
- **Modal for Cart Confirmation**: A modal that appears when a product is added to the cart, showing product details and a confirmation button.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Font Awesome
- **Styling**: CSS for layout and design
- **Version Control**: Git for version management, GitHub for hosting the repository

## Challenges Faced

1. **Routing Management**: Implementing proper routing for the Thank You page while ensuring the user experience was seamless.
2. **State Management**: Managing the state for the cart and product details to provide real-time updates to the user interface.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is mobile-friendly and adjusts well to different screen sizes.

## Running the Project

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
